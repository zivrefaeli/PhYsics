# Physics Simulations

Simulations of topics I learned in physics class in high school - `Ballistics` and `Electricity`.

Developed in Python with *Pygame* library and based on physics equations.

## Demo

Motion of an object in air

Motion of a particle in electric and magnetic field

![electricity](/assets/electricity.gif)

## Usage

For **ballistics** simulation run:

```bash
python ballistics.py
```

Use the `mouse` to aim, and click on `space` to lunch the object.

<br />

For **electricity** simulation run:

```bash
python electricity.py
```

Click on `mouse` to place Electrons/Protons, and `scroll` to change particle's charge.

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | ------- |
| `c` | Remove all particles |
| `Shift + c` | Remove all fields |
| `m` | Create magnetic field |
| `e` | Create electric field |
| `s` | Switch field direction/charge |

# Physics Simulations

Simulations of topics I learned in physics class in high school - `Ballistics` and `Electricity`.

Developed in Python with *Pygame* library and based on physics equations.

## Demo

motion of an object in air

```

For `electricity` simulation run:

```bash
python electricity.py
```

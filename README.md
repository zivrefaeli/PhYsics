# Physics Simulations

Simulations of topics I learned in physics class in high school - `Ballistics` and `Electricity`.
<br />
Developed in Python with *Pygame* library and based on physics equations.

## Demo

motion of an object in air

![ballistics](/assets/ballistics.gif)

motion of a particle in electric and magnetic field

![electricity](/assets/electricity.gif)

## Usage

For **ballistics** simulation run:

```bash
python ballistics.py
```

Use the `mouse` to aim, and click on `space` to lunch the object

For **electricity** simulation run:

```bash
python electricity.py
```

Click on `mouse` to place Protons/Electrons, and `scroll` to change particle's charge.

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | ------- |
| `c` | remove all particles |
| `Shift + c` | remove all fields |
| `m` | create magnetic field |
| `e` | create electric field |
| `s` | switch field direction/charge |
